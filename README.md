# ReactMonitor
Quickly visualize React's component tree performance for improved onboarding and debugging

## What does it do
By using the ReactMonitor Chrome DevTool, beginning and experienced developers alike are able to get a visual representation of an existing codebase that they are working on. Built with React, this tool will dynamically traverse the fiber root object behind the scenes, displaying state, props and render times and the type of components on the page.
